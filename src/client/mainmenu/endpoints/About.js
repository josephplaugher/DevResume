        <p className="text">
            I began learning web development out of curiosity. I had always had
            an interest in software but never taken the time to learn it.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
            I wasn't sure where to begin, but I follow the business world and I
            heard that the internet was taking over the software industry.
            Applications were being moved to the cloud and away from native. I
            learned PHP becausee my understanding was it was a good place to
            start. Then I moved on to JavaScript after learning about React and
            Single Page Apps. Now almost all my projects use a React front-end
            and Node backend with Express. I use vanilla JavaScript for very
            simple applications.
